# sixDegrees
This project is the implementation of an Artificial Inteligence. It's based on the game "Six Degrees of Bacon". The AI will search for two given actor or actress and will try to find the connection between them. How many people and who connects these two people we want to find?

The database is from IMDB

This is my implementation of a project from an AI course. You can check the original here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/degrees/
